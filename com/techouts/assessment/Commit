feat(grade): add if-else and switch case calculators
Type: feat = new feature.
Scope: grade = the grading module/feature.
Meaning: You introduced two new implementations for grade calculation (one using if-else, another using switch-case).
When to use: Any time you add a new user-facing capability.

fix(grade): handle negative score input validation
Type: fix = bug fix.
Scope: grade.
Meaning: You corrected behavior where negative scores were allowed or caused wrong output; now the program validates input and prevents invalid scores.
When to use: Correcting incorrect behavior.

refactor(grade): extract constants for grade thresholds
Type: refactor = internal code improvement (no behavior change).
Scope: grade.
Meaning: You moved magic numbers (like 60, 70, 80, 90) into named constants, improving readability and maintainability without changing how the program behaves.
When to use: Cleanups that don’t change functionality.

docs(README): document usage and examples for grading programs
Type: docs = documentation only.
Scope: README.
Meaning: You updated README with instructions, examples, or explanations for using the grading programs.
When to use: Changes only to documentation (README, Javadoc, wiki)

test(grade): add unit tests for boundary values
Type: test = tests added/changed.
Scope: grade.
Meaning: You added tests for edge/boundary scores (e.g., 0, 59, 60, 69, 70, 79, 80, 89, 90, 91, 100) to ensure the grading logic is correct.
When to use: Any test-only change.

chore(build): configure CI for Java 21 and enable SonarLint checks
Type: chore = tooling/maintenance (not source code logic).
Scope: build.
Meaning: You changed build/CI setup—e.g., GitHub Actions to use Java 21, and SonarLint/SonarQube integration—without changing application behavior.
When to use: Changes to build scripts, CI, dependencies, formatting—non-feature work.


Tips:

Imperative mood (“add”, “fix”, “refactor”)
Scope in parentheses
Keep subject ≤ 72 chars, optional body with context
