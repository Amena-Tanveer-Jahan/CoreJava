SonarLint is an IDE plugin (for IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.) ,
that helps developers write clean, maintainable, and bug-free code by analyzing it as you type.

 1. Real-time Code Analysis
SonarLint scans your code instantly while you write.
It highlights bugs, and bad practices before  running the program.

 2. Enforces Coding Standards
Proper naming conventions
Avoiding magic numbers
Correct access modifiers
Resource management

 3. Prevents Common Bugs
Detects null pointer risks, unused variables, dead code, and unreachable statements.

4. Improves Maintainability
Flags complex methods, duplicate code, and long classes.
Suggests refactoring for better readability and maintainability.

 5. Security Checks
Identifies SQL injection risks, hardcoded credentials, and other vulnerabilities.
Helps you write secure code from the start.

6. Integration with SonarQube/SonarCloud
Syncs with team rules and quality gates.
Ensures your local code meets the same standards as your CI/CD pipeline.
